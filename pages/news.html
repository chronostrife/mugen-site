		More of a blog post/status update. If by some chance you were following my progress on Trello/MFG Screenshots Thread/Facebook, I was going strong in August and September then vanished in early October. I got sick. I've mostly recovered throughout November and actually started working on Trunkz again starting light by doing is DBSuper hyper sprites(all the SSj ones are done!). I'm now having problems again, so I'm working those out hopefully before Christmas before I use the computer much at all again. I may end up bailing out on the Beam System for Mu1.1 I was working on, or just leave it as is for now and release v1.0 of the system in it's imperfect state.
		<br/>
		That's pretty much it! Where will I post updates now? I don't know.. actually. Here maybe? Facebook is a crap-hole of political victimization, clickbait, and advertising so I very rarely post there anymore. Trello will get updates as I find them useful. I'll make a WIP thread on MFG when I feel I can justify it, until then you can see me there trolling around on occasion in General/ATL threads, unless I eventually get bant for mass disrespect or something.

		He has no hypers yet and honestly he is more of an FX test than anything. My current WIP is the CommonFX System I'm putting together for my own characters. Up front it is a ton of work but should speed character production up by a huge amount as it keeps me from using photoshop for almost everything including hue shifts. I've been more or less throwing 2 hours a day into for the past 3 months. Learned alot the engine in the process and have better ways of doing alot of what is already in there! With that said I'll hopefully get some more updates going.</br>

		Hey all, I was KO'd pretty hard by the flu and needed to spend more time catching up on things IRL that I fell behind on. In the past week it seems 000webhost thought it would be a good idea to delete half of my files again without any warning or notification prior or after the removal. So basically as far as a free host, I'm only expecting html pages and simple images to stay online here, fair enough. I am currently moving all my characters/stages/addons/dnz2k5 over to my mediafire account. I'll update their pages later but for now:
		<br/>
		<a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?vp7te18i944hv" target="_blank">All characters and stages are available here! Click Me!</a>
		<br/><br/>
		Benhazard resprited my Garlic Jr sheet and made some stylish looking basics which look much better than some of the old Bojack/Piccolo Stuff I was using. He also added a few new attacks to it as well as some additional frames for the stance, basics, etc. So I am sprite swapping the old Garlic Jr 1.5, and I'll update some of the more worthless abilities (Dead Zone and Garlic Smash), and see if I can get a couple more specials thrown in. Then I'll make him 1.1 Compatible. No promises on a future release! Y'all know me, same old G! I could disappear at random due women, work, or wibbles.

		For those who missed it, I released 16 yesterday for Mugen 1.1, but he does include an alternate DEF that calls code and sprites for Mugen 1.0! (The 1.0 version isn't as polished as the 1.1 version)
		<br/><br/>
		Today I uploaded 7 of my Mugen 1.1 stages, 3 Hi-Res stages and 4 Hybrid Res stages. They will run in Mugen 1.0 it seems, but they will have very poor FPS. If you are a stage designer and programmer feel free to take a look at the code and some of the new functions (it's almost the same just zoom, name, and scale/rotation stuff).
		<br/><br/>
		There are still 2 incomplete stages that Roken put together for me sprite wise, SB2 - Earth Day (Cell's Stage) and BYR - Canyon (Cell's Stage again!). I need to do a bit of cleaning to the SB2 Earth Day stage before I piece it all together again. I need to make the ground tile, and add minor hills to the ground, simple stuff.
		<br/><br/>
		I'll try to suck it up and get Krillin finished next, since he IS a Mugen 1.0 character.

		I know a MUGEN related promise from me coming through lately is about as likely as the world ending on Dec. 21st! However assuming hell does freeze over, a preview of what is to come can be found in the Movelists section!</br> He is 100% finished and functional for Mugen 1.1. I still have the older SFF which is SFFv1(WinMugen, Mugen1.0) so I am going to try and make sure it still works with his current build and get a v1.0 release out. It's 16 by the way. His movelist is slightly more interactive than the others! Roll the mouse over his preview images and they change! Well like half of them do. Some are fully explained in a single frame. 
		</br></br>
		If all goes through (unlikely I know) Krillin for Mugen1.0 will also be coming. He is done as well, I just have to remember which states I gave invalid animations to. I am 99% sure it was win poses planned for his 3/4 costumes, but it's been a year since I touched him. 
		</br></br>
		In addition I'll try and package these 7 Mugen 1.1 stages:<br>
		Improved versions of my 3 snow stages.(Hi-brid Res)</br>Daytime and Sunset Desert stages.(SB2 Hi-Res)</br>Cloudy Mountain Top DBZ styled stage. (DBKai Intro inspried, Hi-brid Res) </br>Starry Night (SB3 Hi-Res)
	    </br></br>
		I know MUGEN 1.1 hasn't released at this time, but when it does come out you'll have some modernized old school DBZ stages which are all very pretty at least! I have a good feeling about Mugen 1.1 and this Christmas though!
		</br></br>
		I have been working for a living now for over two years making the big $$$, even after becoming a single bachelor 6-7 months ago, I am still too tired or reckless to sit and work on MUGEN. But I've still got projects to finish, so I'll get what I can before my health diminishes more and some sanity yet remains within me!

		I've been very very busy, but I went ahead a fixed up the Spritesheet page so there are 3 characters listed row instead of one. Basically, I coded a PHP routine to build a table based on an array. The page pops open pretty quick depite there being a loop to read an array(1 loop per cell) and a table so maybe I did things alright. (Until some pretentious web dev pops in saying "hur hur tables r ghey hur hur retard")
		<br/><br/>
		I combined all the Krillin pallettes awhile ago. Buu Saga Krillin had all kinds of obnoxious pallette issues(random pixels in off colors etc), I'm sure I'll have to fix him more once he's animated in MUGEN. I hope to have something ready for Christmas, but it's very unlikely with work being as bad as it's been... +Skyrim and Terraria 1.1, I mean COME ON! :o)

		It's been a long time since I've shown anything even remotely related to Mugen being worked on, aside from this website. The TheLegendarySSW asked if I'd be doing a Saiyan Saga Krillin to go with the character. At the time no, but he got me thinking about how making that sprite set would be too bad at this point. Copy the pants below the knees on my Buu Saga Krillin, the transfer them over to my Cell Saga Krillin, Add socks, edit out blue shirts, and done!

		So I added a 404 page finally for those unfinished sections. I plan on trying to get things done closer to Christmas, in terms of both site, and characters. I've been pondering things over on how to properly approach pallette/transformations on individual characters of mine so I can easily add more options and also have throw/custom state compatibility. I have a good method, and need to redo some SFFs. I'll leave 16's alone but I will redo Krillin's .SFF so I can also consider adding a third clothes option. Please don't give your hopes up though as I am fairly busy between the job, homework from the job, girlfriend, and otehr random stuff I need to or would rather do! If No progress is made on 16 and Krillin by Xmas, I'll release the MUGEN 1.1 versions of them, even if Mugen 1.1 is not realeased yet. Downgrading them to 1.0 would be fairly simple anyway.. "Then why don't you just downgrade them?" You may be asking! The answer is simply, "Because I really don't feel like it." and that is all the reason I need not to do something MUGEN related.

		I've been keeping busy, both IRL and online. I uploaded Trunkz and Cloud Beta 2's Preview videos, so now people can see what they've got going on(more of these and movelists to come). I also got the MISC page up, not all the links are working in there yet, but you can gain access to my sprite sheets from there! In addition I'm adding Yuuna Miyama as a sort of site mascot of sorts for now, thanks to a certain lovely lady who gave me the idea. I need to make a whole bunch more images of her like that then I'll code in something to hopefully pick them in a looping order for news posts. Until then she will just be shown on the most recent news.

		ZGTeam Forumz is changing too, some of us their are adding to the board. Spoiler tags, larger avatars, and a wider board.
		<br/><br/>
		Oh and if you like Minecraft I also uploaded most of the player skins I created for it. Use them, edit them, enjoy them! (You can find them in the MISC section).

		I've modified the template for my character's ReadMe/Movelists a bit to match this site. For now you can view Garlic Jr's Movelist, I will make downloadable versions too in the future as well but will also continue to include them in my characters. I also plan to make youtube preview video's for all of my existing characters. Some obviously exist already, but for Yamcha, Trunkz, Cloud and such there isn't much to see so far. Hopefully that will change soon, as well as my lack of a sprite sheets section.
		<br/><br/>
		ZGTeam Forumz is still back(link is below), feel free to register and post there! If you remember it being too strict with rules in ages past, we plan to make the forum much more leniant.
		<br/><br/>
		<b>Update:</b> Desaturated the "in progress" portraits on the Characters page slightly more. Also added the Piccolo WIP page.

		To those who didn't know about it this is my new website for hosting and releasing new Mugen content. There is still some more things I need to do, but for now all my old Mugen material is avaialable for download. Please report any dead links or corrupt files.
		<br/><br/>
		Before anyone gets too excited, the greyed out characters may or may not be WIPs currently, but they do serve as a guideline for some of my future Mugen plans, if I ever get around to finishing it. :)
		<br/><br/>
		<b>Update:</b> ZGTeam Forum has just returned to the world of the living. We reopened the old forum from 2004-2006. Expect to see some information about 16 and Krillin soon. Info on Mugen 1.1, and catching up on old times!

		As you can see I still have a ways to go. I've got most of the files transferred over and am getting each chaarcter page going. I will likely remove the WIP part of the bar for something else since my Characters page will serve as a WIP page as well. So far 17, 18, Bojack, and GarlicJr are set up. I'll take care of the rest then start on the Stages page. The movelists are not online yet! I may end up redesigning them for this site. Or... maybe not! 
		<br/><br/>
		In other news, ZGTeam Forumz might be making a return! Hurray! :D

		This site will be under construction for some time. I'll add content such as my Mugen characters, stages, add-ons, as well as some other goodies. The intent is to replace my good old lycos website. More details to come later.
